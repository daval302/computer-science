It is also used to evaluate a math expression nested one by one between parenthesis: the main expression goes to evaluate when another sub-expression has to be evaluated, so basiclly it store the main expresion into the stack, than evaluate the sub-expression or store another sub-expression into the stack until there are no more sub-expression so that it pop out from the stack the last added, evaluate that, pop out from the stack an upper expression replacing the previous result where the sub-expression was placed, and so on to the main expression.\n",
